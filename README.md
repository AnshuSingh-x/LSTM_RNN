# Next Word Prediction with LSTM RNN

This project is a deep learning model built using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Recurrent Neural Network to predict the next word in a sequence of text. It demonstrates how neural networks can be used for natural language processing tasks like language modeling and text generation.

📌 Features

Trained on a custom corpus (hamlet dataset)

Tokenization and sequence padding

Word embedding for better context understanding

LSTM-based RNN architecture

Predicts the next word based on a given sentence fragment
